## Extract

For the extract portion of this assignment, we first loaded in all of our data, which created four separate dataframes. For the dataframe containing the happiness score, we dropped all columns except the country name and the score. 

For the dataframes from the World Bank, we selected only the country name and 2019 data, effectively removing the other columns. We renamed the '2019' column to indicate which indicator we were working with in that dataframe. We also dropped all null values, since we only had the one column in each dataframe. 

Once each dataframe was narrowed to the colums we needed, we exported them as a csv back out the resources folder for next steps.
